<h3>Filters</h3>

<p>To make it easy to browse the store, you can use product filters, which can apply to all store products or can be specific to certain categories.</p>

<p>For example, you can create a filter called <b>Manufacturer</b>, containing a manufacturers list of the cell phones sold in the store. Another filter called Screen may contain the <b>screen size</b> options of these phones and so on.</p>

<p>The more filters each product has, the easier it will be for your customer to find the desired product.</p>

<h3>Product categorization</h3>

<p>The category hierarchy is of extreme importance for a virtual store. If it is well done, your customers will find the products much more easily.</p>

<p>Enter the item <b>Products > Show Categories</b> of the control panel to see the current category hierarchy.</p>

<br><br>

<h3>Cross selling and Frequently bought together</h3>

<p>In cross selling, the store recommends <i>similar</i> products. In the Frequently bought together sale, the store <i>suggests complementary</i> products.</p>

<p>For example, the visitor is on a TV product detail page. In the <b>cross selling</b> section, the store displays similar products, which are other TV models, with links to their respective pages. In the <b>Frequently bought together</b> section, the store suggests that a media player be purchased along with the TV. To place the two products in the cart, just click the <b>Buy</b> button in this section.</p>

<h3>Exclusion of demo products</h3>

<p>Demo products are important for guiding the registration of the products of your store and to better try its resources. Access the details page of these pre-registered products for examples of filling in the fields.</p>

<p>If you no longer need the demo products, they can easily be deleted from the store. First access the <b>User modules</b> to activate the Utility module. Then click the <b>Utilities</b> menu, which is on the left side of the control panel. Search for the <b>Delete automatically inserted products</b> utility. When you open the new window, check the <b>Delete all</b> field if you want the demo products that have been modified by you to be removed as well. Click <b>Execute</b> and confirm the deletion.</p>

<p>Optionally, you can exclude the products filters and categories that were automatically registered when the store was created:</p>

<br><h4>Deleting Filters</h4>
<p>Access the <b>STORE CONFIGURATION</b> page of the control panel. In the <b>PRODUCTS</b> section, click the arrow to the right of the <b>Product attributes filters</b> field to list the filters and click the item you want to delete. Then press the <b>Delete</b> button.</p>

<br><h4>Deleting categories</h4>
<p>Access <b>PRODUCTS > Show categories</b> on the control panel to see the registered categories. Click the <b>Delete</b> button next to each category you want to delete.</p>

<br><br><hr>
<p><b>NOTE<sup>1</sup>:</b> The demo products are priced much higher than the market price to prevent real orders from occurring. In addition, while in deployment the store will display a message to the visitor stating that all orders will be considered as tests and will not be sent.</p>

<br><br>
<p><b>NOTE<sup>2</sup>:</b> The product images files are located in the <b>PROD</b> folder of the store. To acess this folder, go to <b>User modules</b> and active the Files module. Then click the <b>Files</b> link at the top of the control panel.<br><br>The demo products images are in an external URL. This way it is not necessary to delete their files. This external URL is set in the <code>STORE CONFIGURATION > Products > Image path</code>. To reference this URL, the images of the demonstration products were registered with the <code>#</code> character before the name of each file, in the product details page. Do not use this character when registering the product images that are in the PROD folder.</p>
