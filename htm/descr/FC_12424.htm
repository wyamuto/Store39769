<p>Even with this caution, your password will be exposed to third parties if you access the control panel through a computer infected by a virus or malicious program created for this purpose. To prevent this from occurring, you can add an <b>additional level of user authentication</b>, which is the request for a <b>One-Time Passwords (OTP)</b>. This password is generated by a free OTP application installed on your mobile phone and can only be used once, in a short period after its generation.<p>

<p>To access the control panel, the user who has this feature enabled will have to enter his normal password and then will have to enter the disposable password generated by the OTP application on his cell phone. If this one-time password is captured by a third party, it will be useless because it can not be used again.</p>

<p>Follow the step-by-step guide to configure this important security feature. This procedure only needs to be done once:</p>

<ol><li><p>Install the password generation application (OTP) on your phone or tablet, according to your device type (iPhone, Android, Windows Phone, Java etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Access the <b>User password</b> page on the control panel of the virtual store. Enter your user password and leave the remaining fields blank.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <b>One-Time Password (OTP)</b> section, enter the <b>OTP Secret</b> field that will be informed by the mobile application.</p></li>
<li><p>In the mobile application, enter the 4 digits entered in red in the <b>PIN</b> field and ask for the respective password.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the disposable password in the <b>Password</b> field of the One-Time Password (OTP)</p></li>
<li><p>Press the <b>SAVE</b> button to activate the feature.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>On your next access to the control panel, after entering your normal access password, you will need to enter the <b>PIN</b> in the mobile application, which in turn will respond with a disposable password. This additional password must be entered in the <b>Password</b> field of the control panel so that the user can complete their login.</p>

<p><b class="dest">ATTENTION:</b> Always use the user with the OTP feature enabled when accessing the control panel from a shared computer, such as a lan house. A good practice is to register an additional user to be used outside of your personal computer, with OTP enabled and more restricted access.</p>
