<p><b>NOTE:</b> You can register more than one filter with the same name. For example, if the store sells TVs and cell phones, register a <i>screen size</i> filter for each product category. This way, when accessing the category of TVs, will be presented the screen size options of TVs and not of cell phones.</p>
