<h2>1) Choose the domain name</h2>
<p>When choosing the domain, prefer short names with easy typing. Avoid numbers and names that are hard to spell or tough to pronounce.</p>
<p>Choose a name that is easy to remember. Also try to use words that describe your company so visitors know what your business is about. This can be helpful for search rankings.</p>
<p>Avoid names that are similar to existing brands.</p>


<h2>2) Choose the domain suffix (e.g. <i>.com, .org, .net</i>)</h2>
<p>The suffix identifies the name as belonging to a specific top-level domain (TLD). There are numerous TLDs available for general purchase, including .com, .org and .net. The most popular is .com, which is supposed to indicate commercial sites, but includes almost everything.</p>


<h2>3) Choose a domain registrar</h2>
<p>You must choose a registrar to host your new domain. There are many companies that offer this service, like GoDaddy and Verisign. Please choose only an ICANN accredited registrar.</p>
<p>After registering your domain, you will need to create two DNS entries in the registrar's control panel:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Log into your domain registrar's web portal.</li>
<li>Launch the <b>DNS Manager / Domain Management Page / DNS Control Panel</b> for your account, which lists all the domains you have already registered.</li>
<li>Locate the registered domain you will use for your store.</li>
<li>Locate the <b>CNAME WWW record</b> for this domain.</li>
<li>Remove any existing entries that you might have in this record.</li>
<li>Select the <b>Add Record</b> option.</li>
<li>Specify the value in <b>Name / Host</b> field as <b>www</b>.</li>
<li>Specify the first record's value as <b>buzios.rumo.com.br</b>.</li>
<li>Click <b>Save zone file/ Save / Add records</b> to save your changes.</li>
<li>Select the <b>Add Record</b> option.</li>
<li>Specify the value in <b>Name / Host</b> field as either <b>@</b> or leave it blank.</li>
<li>Specify the first record's value as <b>201.20.10.204</b>.</li>
<li>Click <b>Save zone file / Save / Add records</b> to save your changes.</li>
</ol></p>

<h2>4) Wait the domain to propagate</h2>
<p>After you register and configure the domain name, you will have to wait some hours or even some days for it to propagate. Typically, you should expect to see the domain name up and running within 48 hours.</p>

<h2>5) Ask for your free domain security certificate</h2>
<p>OK, now your domain is up and running on your ehcommerce store. You can now <a href=mailto:support@ehcommerce.com>send us a message</a> to ask for your free domain security certificate configuration.</p>
