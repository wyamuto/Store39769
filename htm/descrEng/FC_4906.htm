<p>The size limit in Kbytes per photo is 200 kb. On average, the images should not exceed 100 kb, so that navigation is fast even in mobile access.</p>

<p><b>TIPS:</b> We suggest that the photos of the products have their width and height proportional.<br>Several price comparison portals and virtual malls display product photos in size 200x200 pixels. If the product photo of the store has dimensions 220x130 for example, this photo will be distorted in these portals, impairing the conversion of clicks on the product.</p>
